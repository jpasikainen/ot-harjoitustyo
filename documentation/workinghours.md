| Date  | Time (h) | Summary |
| ----- | -------- | ------- |
| 11/07 | 4        | Setup the IDE, wrote pom, created a testing database and a class for it.  |
| 11/10 | 4 | Added base functionality to the game: Text UI, Player & Plant classes, and refactored how the data is handled. Implemented JUnit testing and wrote a sample test for the Field class. |
| 11/11 | 5 | Tried to make complicated a game loop, realized that timers will do just fine. Researched possible frameworks required in future development. Fixed textUI input from accidental incorrect input. |
